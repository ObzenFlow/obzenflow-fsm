# Code of Conduct

This project aims to be a welcoming community.

## Our standards

We expect all participants to:

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and communicate clearly.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, and other community channels).

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Preferred (private): open a GitHub Security Advisory and clearly label it as a Code of Conduct report:
  https://github.com/ObzenFlow/obzenflow-fsm/security/advisories/new
- Alternative (public): open an issue and request that the conversation move to a private channel.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban from project spaces.
