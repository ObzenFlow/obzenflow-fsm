# Trademarks

“ObzenFlow” and related logos and brand assets are trademarks of the ObzenFlow project and/or its contributors.

You may use the name “ObzenFlow” to truthfully refer to this project, but you may not:

- Suggest sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation without permission.
- Use ObzenFlow trademarks in a way that is confusingly similar to official branding.

If you have questions about trademark usage, open an issue for discussion.
